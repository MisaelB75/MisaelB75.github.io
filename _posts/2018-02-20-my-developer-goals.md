# Frontend Developer Goals
My goals as a Frontend developer are two-fold.  One is to help organizations that may not normally have the funds to hire someone to create or update their websites.  The other is two be able to do work from home after I retire to keep me busy and possibly earn some additional spending cash when retired.

Being in the military I have come across various organizations and programs that are designed to help someone in the military or a veteran.  Unfortunately the websites are not always easy to navigate or user friendly.  I hope that the skills that I learn at Bloc will allow me to help these programs and organizations in creating websites that donâ€™t detract from their focus and instead allows the user find the information and help that they are looking for.

I also will be retiring from the military in about five years and hope that the skills that I have learned, and are continuing to refine, can be used to work from home.  I have been away from my family for many years as I was sent to godforsaken countries and I would love it if I can stay at home with my kids and my wife.

Ultimately the knowledge and skills that I do get will help me whether it is by allowing me to stay home or buy helping others in their quest to serve service members and veterans.
