# Coding at 40

## My Bloc Journey So Far
It has not been an easy road into learning the different modules that are taught by Bloc.  Unfortunately one of the most common difficulties that I have come across has been making time to do the assignments.  My current work situation has me traveling a lot which is not conducive to doing the assignments.  I am not always able to take a personal laptop to the different places that I go so I have lost weeks not being able to get work done.  Of course I am still hopeful.  I have learned much so far which has set the foundation for me to continue the path to becoming a great at coding.

## Military and tired of be away from the family all the time
One of the drawbacks of being in the military is being away from my family.  I have missed many important events in my children’s lives.  I don’t want to continue to be away once I retire.  In fact, I want to reduce the amount of time that I spend commuting.  I would spend anywhere between an hour to an hour and a half going one way.  

## Retirement doesn’t mean the end of work…
As I am getting ready to retire I began to ask the same question that most kids ask.  What do I want to be when I grow up, or in this case, when I retire?  I am hoping that Coding is that answer but only time will tell.  So far I have enjoyed what I have learned and I am excited on what the next chapter (or checkpoint) holds.  
>While there are some individuals that would be fine with not working another day in their life, I am not one of them.

## Something that I’ve always wanted to do…
Can you teach an old dog an old trick?  I hope so.  Learning how to code is not necessarily new to me.  That being said it has been decades since I dabbled in it.  Of course it was called programming back then and I was learning Q-BASIC which is probably not very useful now.  It did however plant the seed in my fascination with programming and computers.

If you are thinking of coding and are not a spring chicken then do not think that you are too old to learn coding.  The building “bloc” approach to training helps ensure that there is a solid foundation for you as you begin the journey on coding.
