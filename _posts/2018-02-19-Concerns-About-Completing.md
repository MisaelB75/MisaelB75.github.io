# Bloc Completing Goals
As I get closer to completing the Bloc program, I have come to realize that I will not be able to complete the full curriculum.  I have not let that discourage me.  I am still hoping to learn as much as I can from Bloc before I reach the end of the timeframe.  Unfortunately my job has caused sufficient delays to set me back significantly.  However the skills that I have learned from Bloc so far have given me the tools to continue to learn.

I am hoping to at least complete the Frontend portion of the curriculum.  This will at least allow me to have the skills necessary to help with website development.  I am hoping to get a taste of Backend fundamental's to at least know what it consists of and where I can get additional resources on what it is.
