I am learning how to code and looking to help out non-profits who don't have the resources to update and spruce up their websites. Contact me and let me show you how your website can be updated.

<form action="https://getsimpleform.com/messages?form_api_token=1befa8e22072f1557eddfac260346691" method="post">
  <!-- the redirect_to is optional, the form will redirect to the referrer on submission -->
  <input type='hidden' name='redirect_to' value='http://misaelb75.github.io/thank-you/'<!--Changes would be made here to the URL--> />
  <input type='text' name='name' placeholder='Your Full Name' />
  <input type='email' name='email' placeholder='Your E-mail Address' />
  <textarea name='message' placeholder='Write your message ...'></textarea>
  <input type='submit' value='Send Message' />
</form>
