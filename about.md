I began the journey on learning on how to code as a way to keep myself busy and have come to enjoy it.  There is a lot more to a webpage than meets the eyes.  There are various layers that a page may have that is transparent to the user and that's the way that it should be.

Coding is ever evolving and I enjoy the challenge.  I am looking forward to the challenges that helping develop your intricate site may have.
