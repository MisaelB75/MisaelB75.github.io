<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<p>The project was the creation of a <strong><em>Spotify-like</em></strong> site which is called <strong>BlocJams</strong>.  The creation of the site was part of the curriculum for a code learning site which used a building block approach to learning.</p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>The endstate was to develop a site in which a user could listen to the music that they desired.  The user would be able to scroll through various artists, albums and songs.  Once a song is chosen the user will be able to play, pause, scroll, skip and replay songs.  Throughout the development of the site there were several issues that arose.  While some were part of the curriculum and were used to help refine the coding learning process, most were self induced as I learned the intricacies of learning how to code.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Many of the errors that I created were due to improper or missing syntax.  I found that the Google Chrome console was most beneficial in finding where the issues were.  The other alternative was going line by line and looking for errors but I found this tedious and a waste of manhours especially when there were many lines of code.  Google Chrome console helped isolate the code line where the errors occurred.  This helped narrow where the issue were and allowed me to focus on smaller more manageable size of code.  This was done until the console showed no errors and the code worked as expected.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>The initial testing of the site discovered issues with a couple of the advertised features.  Some of these issues were the inability to pause, go back on the playlist, and being unable to use the seek bar while a song was playing.  These issues were resolved once they were troubleshot.  The subsequent testing did not show any issues with the site and worked as advertised.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The webpage had some common issues across the various sites.  Some of these issues could have been avoided through attention to detail when writing the code.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Brackets, parenthesis and semicolons were common errors that could have been avoided.  Paying attention while creating a website would have helped alleviate most of the issues.  The console debugger was utilized to correct the issues on the site which worked well.  Each of the issues were resolved one problem at a time and Google Chrome console was a good tool to utilize.  This helped reinforce the saying “Brilliance in the Basics.”  Reinforcing the basics of using proper syntax would have alleviated several of the errors and the time needed to correct them.</p>
